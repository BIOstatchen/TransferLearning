# TransferLearning


Background
Due to ethnic heterogeneity in genetic structure, genetic risk scores (GRS) constructed in European populations typically possess poor portability in underrepresented non-European populations. We aim here to explore the predictive performance of the GRS for traits by exploiting existing knowledge of genetic similarity obtained from Europeans. In this work, we refer to the primary population (e.g. EUR) as the auxiliary population and the underrepresented population (e.g. AFR/EAS) as the target population

(https://github.com/BIOstatchen/Transfer-Learning) is implemented in R statistical environment.
